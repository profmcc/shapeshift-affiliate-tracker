# Experiments Directory

This directory contains experimental features and approaches that are being tested but are not yet production-ready.

## Contents

- **not_working_at_all/**: Attempts that didn't work and lessons learned
- **partially_working/**: Features that work partially but need refinement

## Purpose

These experiments help us:
- Test new approaches without affecting the main codebase
- Learn from failures and document lessons learned
- Iterate on ideas before committing to production
- Maintain a clean separation between stable and experimental code

## Status

⚠️ **Warning**: Code in this directory is experimental and may not work as expected.

## Contributing

If you want to work on experimental features:
1. Create a new subdirectory for your experiment
2. Document what you're trying to achieve
3. Test thoroughly before proposing to move to production
4. Update this README with your experiment's status
