# Twitter Thread: Reverse Engineering DeFi Affiliate Revenue 🧵

## Tweet 1/12 🎯
🔍 Deep dive into reverse engineering affiliate revenue streams across DeFi protocols. Building comprehensive tracking systems for @ShapeShift_io's partnerships with major protocols like @0xProtocol, @CowSwap, @relay_link, and @Portals_fi. 

The complexity is wild. 🧵👇

## Tweet 2/12 💰
Each protocol handles affiliate fees completely differently:

- Portals: Direct ERC20 transfers with affiliate metadata
- CowSwap: Weekly settlements with app_code tracking
- 0x: AffiliateFeeTransformer contract interactions
- Relay: Cross-chain app fees settled on Base

No standardization = maximum headaches 😅

## Tweet 3/12 🔧
Built custom listeners for each protocol:
- Event log parsing across 8+ chains
- ABI decoding for contract interactions
- Rate-limited API integrations
- SQLite databases for historical analysis
- Token price feeds for USD calculations

Each requiring different technical approaches.

## Tweet 4/12 🌐
**CowSwap Challenge**: Their API rate limits at 429 errors when trying to fetch historical data. Solution? Built a comprehensive token cache system with 1,531+ cached tokens to eliminate redundant API calls.

From breaking APIs to smooth data collection. 📈

## Tweet 5/12 🔗
**Relay Protocol**: They have a relay.link browser for exploring transactions, but no direct ShapeShift affiliate tracking. Built programmatic scrapers to:
- Discover API endpoints
- Extract transaction data
- Identify app fee structures
- Cross-reference with ShapeShift's address

## Tweet 6/12 ⛓️
**Cross-chain complexity**: Relay settles fees on Base chain while transactions happen across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, etc. Had to build multi-chain monitoring systems to track the complete affiliate fee flow.

Each chain = different RPC quirks to handle.

## Tweet 7/12 💡
**Real findings so far**:
- Portals: $454 WETH confirmed affiliate fee ✅
- CowSwap: ~$250-2,500 estimated (corrected from initial $70K miscalculation)
- Relay: Active integration confirmed, monitoring Base settlements
- 0x Protocol: Multiple integration points discovered

## Tweet 8/12 🏗️
**Technical stack**:
- Python for data collection & analysis
- Web3.py for blockchain interactions
- SQLite for local data storage
- Custom ABI decoders
- Rate limiting & retry logic
- Token price normalization
- Multi-protocol abstraction layers

## Tweet 9/12 🚨
**Major complications encountered**:
- APIs going down mid-analysis
- Decimal precision errors (18 vs 6 vs 8 decimals)
- Rate limiting across multiple services
- Missing historical data
- Protocol updates breaking integrations
- Cross-chain timing issues

## Tweet 10/12 🔬
**Methodology**:
1. Protocol documentation deep-dive
2. Contract address discovery
3. Event signature analysis  
4. Historical transaction parsing
5. Fee calculation verification
6. USD value normalization
7. Data validation across sources

Real forensic accounting in DeFi.

## Tweet 11/12 📊
Built comprehensive dashboards showing:
- Revenue by protocol over time
- Transaction volume vs affiliate fees
- Cross-chain distribution patterns
- Settlement timing analysis
- Fee rate comparisons

Making the invisible visible. 👁️

## Tweet 12/12 🎯
**Why this matters**: Affiliate revenue is a massive but opaque part of DeFi. Most protocols don't provide clear tracking. Building these systems helps:
- Optimize partnership strategies
- Validate revenue reporting
- Identify high-value integrations
- Drive product decisions

DeFi needs better data infrastructure. 🚀
